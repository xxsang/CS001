# 0.1 Computing and What to Compute

[TOC]

The natural set of questions towards **Computer Science** at the first glance might be *"what is a computer?"* and *"why is it a science?"*. 

The first question seems to be easy. When this first chapter is written at 2019, computers are pervasively everywhere. If someone is learning computer, he/she must have known, seen, or at least heard of computer as an object. The second question seems to be harder. Though science is also pervasively everywhere, it is more of an abstract concept but not a physical object.

Starting from the easier question and diving deeper, the "computer as an object" with colourful interfaces that plays movie, runs games, displays webpages, …, does not seems to be intuitively aligned with the conceptual description — "the thing that computes". If these two concepts must be pointing to the same thing, then *"What is computing there?"*
