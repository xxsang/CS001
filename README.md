I have recently got a part-time to educate an 8-year-old girl who (and whose both parents) has no knowledge in Computer Science the knowledge of Computer Science. This chance drove me into thinking â€” why not writing something to document the process, to motivate myself to learn, and to contribute to the community.

So here comes the supreme motivation of this series. It is designed to be as fundamental as **NO** prior knowledge is required except for understanding natural language (English, though my native language is Chinese); as easy as an 8-year-old can understand; as broad as going beyond the fragmented areas artificially cut by the domain experts; and as deep as possible given all the premises.

It is an ambitious plan, but I would like to start small, and to start today.

This is a progressive learning process as the 8-year-old will grow both biologically and intellectually. And the people behind the screen will also grow biologically and hopefully intellectually as well.
