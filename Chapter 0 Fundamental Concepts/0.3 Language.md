# 0.3 Language

---------

I promised to talk about language in this section but *what is language?* Without going too deep into the philosophical meaning of language and semantics, we can first consider language as a communication tool pervasive in everyday experience. We all proficient on a native language at an early age. We all experience talking, listening, reading and writing each day. The tool we use to talk, to listen to, to read and to write (no matter in what format) is language.

The language we use at most of the time and is called *natural language* (in the format of English at the moment), which is naturally evolved through human history.
